# Optimizing Bus Route Frequency using Real-Time Passenger Load Data

## Overview

This project analyzes real-time passenger load data to optimize bus route frequencies. The goal is to identify routes where adjustments to frequency could minimize passenger wait times and improve the overall efficiency of resource allocation within the public transportation system. The analysis involves data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to provide actionable recommendations for bus route scheduling.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the necessary libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The script requires a properly formatted CSV file containing the real-time passenger load data.  The expected format and location of this file should be specified within the `main.py` script itself.  Please refer to the comments within the code for details.


## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the analysis to the console, including statistics on passenger load, wait times, and suggested frequency adjustments for different routes.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization plots (e.g., histograms of passenger loads, line plots showing passenger load over time) and save them as PNG files in the `output` directory.  These plots provide a visual representation of the data and the analysis results, aiding in understanding the recommendations.  The exact filenames of these plots may vary.
